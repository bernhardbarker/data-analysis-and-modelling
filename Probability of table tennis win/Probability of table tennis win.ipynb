    "This is a small exercise to efficiently calculate the probability of winning at table tennis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "2 players play against each other, where either player scores a point with some probability at each time step. The first player to reach 21 wins. If there's a difference of less than 2 points, the players keep playing until a player wins by getting a lead of 2 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "For a concrete example, I'll do the below analysis for the case where one player has a 60% chance of winning a point.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider playing 40 points, winning exactly 20 points will result in a tie and winning 21 or more points would result in a win. Of course, we stop playing at 21, but continuing playing up to 40 points after winning, or losing, can't change the outcome, since the highest score the other player can reach is 19, so this also accurately calculates the probability of winning had we stopped at 21.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the calculation below to determine the probability of winning from 20-20.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "p(win from equal) = p(2W) + p(WL or LW) * p(win from equal)             Since WL and LW both lead back to an equal score, and 2L is a loss\n",
    "p(win from equal) - p(WL or LW) * p(win from equal) = p(2W)\n",
    "p(win from equal) * (1 - p(WL or LW)) = p(2W)\n",
    "p(win from equal) = p(2W) / (1 - p(WL or LW))\n",
    "p(win from equal) = p(2W) / (p(2W) + p(2L))                             WL, LW, WW and LL are the only possibilities for 2 games, and they're disjoint,\n",
    "                                                                        thus p(2W) + p(2L) = 1 - p(WL or LW)\n",
    "p(win from equal) = 0.6 * 0.6 / (0.6 * 0.6 + 0.4 * 0.4)                 Since p(2W) = p(w)^2 = 0.6 * 0.6, and the same for p(2L)\n",
    "p(win from equal) = 0.6923...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have `p(win) = p(X >= 21) + p(X = 20) * p(win from equal) = 0.8702 + 0.0554 * 0.6923 = 90.9%`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For validating these results, I also wrote a more brute-force method, which exhaustively calculates the probabilities of reaching every pair of scores. Starting with 0-0 with a probability of 1, we use that to determine the probabilities of 1-0 => `1*0.6` and 0-1 => `1*0.4`, from 1-0 we get 2-0 => `1*0.6*0.6` and 1-1 => `1*0.6*0.4`, and so on, summing duplicated probabilities. We repeat this and we add any winning state (won at 21) to the probability of winning and just ignore losing states (lost at 21).\n",
    "\n",
    "This leaves us with 20-20, which we calculate separately, as above.\n",
    "\n",
    "As expected, this also gives a probability of about `90.9%` of winning the game."
